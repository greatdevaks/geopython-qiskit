# Talk Title
Understanding Qiskit: Quantum by Quantum - GeoPython 2021

# Speaker
Anmol Krishan Sachdeva

# Talk Description
High Peformance Computing using Quantum Computing is the future and the GIS community should start learning about its concepts and implementation techniques in order to leverage Quantum Computing for solving complex spatial problems. This talk focuses on introducing the basic concepts of Quantum Computing using Qiskit.

Qiskit is a popular open-source, feature-rich, and modular Quantum Computing Python SDK by IBM. It enables working with Quantum Computers at the level of circuits, algorithms, and application modules.

# Topics Covered
- Basics of Quantum Computation
- Qubits and the Quantum States
- Working with Multiple Qubits
- Qiskit and Qubit Gates
- Hands-on mode
- Building small Quantum Circuits
- Where to go from here
- a roadmap for working with Quantum Algorithms
- Applications for the GIS community (Spatial Algorithms and more)
- Questions and Answers
